The reverse-path-filtering command determines whether incoming packets with a source address that cannot be routed by that interface are accepted and processed. 

sysctl -w “net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter=0”
sysctl -w “net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter=0”
-------------------------------
echo ‘net.ipv4.conf.eth0.rp_filter = 0’ >> /etc/sysctl.conf
echo ‘net.ipv4.conf.eth1.rp_filter = 0’ >> /etc/sysctl.conf
echo ‘net.ipv4.conf.lo.rp_filter = 0’ >> /etc/sysctl.conf
sysctl -p
